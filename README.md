# lds.contexto

I drew inspiration for this project from a game I found online (contexto.me).

My version of the game was used for my final project in LING360 at BYU. 

I split the project into four steps. 
Part one: compline the corpus
Part two: word vector analysis
Part three: build the game
Part four: visualize the word vectors (this visualization represents how the word embeddings would look on a 2-D plane)
